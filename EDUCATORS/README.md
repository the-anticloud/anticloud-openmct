## Teaching with OPENMCT

The project is usable as a worked example of offline-first packaging with a
cryptographic audit chain. It ships with the assurance suite, the evidence
register and the ledger, so students can verify claims rather than take them on
faith.

## Suggested exercises

1. Run `python tools/run_bench.py --out BENCH.json` and read the 16 results.
2. Recompute the SHA3-256 of a row's evidence file and compare to the register.
3. Walk the AIOSS chain from genesis to head `fd7d9d7aa13e5107068fd2436956df6c028ae21d8cf690f2adcea4a9af208145` and confirm every link.
4. Break one artifact and observe the chain fail to verify.
